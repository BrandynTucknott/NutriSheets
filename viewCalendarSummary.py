def view_calendar_summary(start_date, end_date):
    """
    Calculate and return the average daily calories consumed and the average daily food spending 
    for a specified time period.

    This function iterates through meal logs within the inclusive date range specified by start_date 
    and end_date. It computes the average daily calories consumed and the average daily cost of food 
    within this time frame. 

    The function expects the meal log data to be available in a format that it can process, 
    and the logic for accessing and iterating through these logs should be implemented within this function.

    Parameters:
    - start_date (str): A string representing the starting date of the period to analyze, in YYYY-MM-DD format.
    - end_date (str): A string representing the ending date of the period to analyze, in YYYY-MM-DD format.

    Returns:
    - str: A JSON-formatted string containing two key-value pairs: 'average_daily_calories' (float) 
           and 'average_daily_cost' (float). These represent the calculated average daily calories 
           consumed and the average daily food spending, respectively.

    Note: The function currently returns placeholder values (0.0 for calories and 0.0 for cost). The actual logic 
    for calculating these averages needs to be implemented within the function.
